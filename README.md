# audioanalysis-td

I created this audio analyser to be able to gather information from audio source and be able to remap it. 

First output of the tox gives you amplitude of certain frenquency ranges (that you can edit in the tox parameters)
Second output gives you kick, snare and beat detection
Last output is the audio spectrum (you can choose the resolution in the parameters page aswell)
