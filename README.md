# audioanalysis-td

#I created this audio analyser to be able to gather information from audio source and be able to remap it. 

#First output of the Tox gives you amplitude of certain frenquency ranges (that you can edit in the tox parameters)
#Second output is the audio spectrum (you can choose the resolution in the parameters page aswell)
